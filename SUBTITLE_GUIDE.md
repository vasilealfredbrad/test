# 📝 How to Use Subtitles with Your AI Video

## ✅ Current Setup (No ImageMagick Needed!)

Your AI-generated video now comes with **separate subtitle files** instead of burned-in subtitles. This is actually better because:

- ✅ **Faster generation** (no subtitle rendering)
- ✅ **More flexible** (turn subtitles on/off anytime)
- ✅ **No ImageMagick required** (simpler setup)
- ✅ **Professional approach** (how Netflix/YouTube do it)

## 🎬 How to Watch Your Video with Subtitles

### Method 1: VLC Media Player (Recommended)

**VLC automatically detects subtitles if they have the same name!**

1. Make sure your files are named the same:
   ```
   out/
   ├── ai_generated_video_720p.mp4  ← Video
   └── ai_generated_video_720p.srt  ← Subtitles (rename if needed)
   ```

2. Open the video in VLC - subtitles appear automatically!

3. Or manually load subtitles:
   - Open video in VLC
   - Menu → Subtitle → Add Subtitle File
   - Select `out/subtitles.srt`

### Method 2: Windows Media Player

1. Rename `subtitles.srt` to match your video:
   ```
   subtitles.srt → ai_generated_video_720p.srt
   ```

2. Place both files in the same folder

3. Open video - subtitles load automatically

### Method 3: YouTube/Social Media Upload

When uploading to YouTube/TikTok/Instagram:
1. Upload your video: `ai_generated_video_720p.mp4`
2. Upload subtitles separately: `subtitles.srt`
3. Platform will sync them automatically

## 🔥 Want Burned-In Subtitles?

If you really need subtitles permanently in the video:

### Option A: Use the Script's Option 1

```bash
python generate_subtitles.py
```

1. Select **Option 1** (Use Existing Video)
2. When prompted, provide: `out/ai_generated_video_720p.mp4`
3. Script will burn subtitles into it!

### Option B: Quick Rename & Run Again

```bash
# 1. Rename your AI video
ren out\ai_generated_video_720p.mp4 my_base_video.mp4

# 2. Run script with Option 1
python generate_subtitles.py
# Select Option 1
# Input: out/my_base_video.mp4
```

## 📊 Your Current Files

After running Option 2, you have:

```
out/
├── speech.wav                      # Generated audio (Alin's story)
├── subtitles.srt                   # Subtitle file (with timestamps)
└── ai_generated_video_720p.mp4     # Video with audio (no burned subs)
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Rename Subtitles for Auto-Loading:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
copy out\subtitles.srt out\ai_generated_video_720p.srt
```

### Check Your SRT File:
```bash
notepad out\subtitles.srt
```

Should look like:
```
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Meet Alin, a Romanian guy who accidentally

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
became an AI expert overnight.
```

### Test in VLC:
1. Open VLC
2. Drag both files into VLC window
